Visual Studio Code has a timeline feature that lets you see your edits in historical order.

Somehow I've been using VSCode for years and either forgot this existed or never knew about it to begin with.

[Thanks for letting me know, guys](https://bsky.app/profile/christinacodes.dev/post/3lkewwtmams27)
