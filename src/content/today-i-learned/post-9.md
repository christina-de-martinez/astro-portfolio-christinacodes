Another plug for one of [Chris'](https://codinginpublic.dev/) videos! (Honestly, get used to it, I am a Coding In Public stan).

[YouTube: Never Forget React forwardRef Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vw6uG1JSEA)

For some reason, `forwardRef` is one of those concepts that I get, but it just never sticks fully in my mind. Like, my brain just refuses to think that way.

I'm sort of glad that [React 19 deprecated it](https://react.dev/reference/react/forwardRef)... but we're a bit behind at my day job, so I still have to use it for a while.

This video helped me understand forwardRef and also introduced me to `useImperativeHandle`.
