I wanted to test the way that Grammarly interacted with my iOS app, but found that I couldn't reasonably get grammarly on my simulator.

That's because you can't download apps from the App Store in an iOS simulator. If you want to test something that interacts with other apps, you need to debug on a physical device, which is a much more involved process.
