I learned about the [Endpoints Explorer in Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/min-web-api?view=aspnetcore-9.0&tabs=visual-studio#test-posting-data).

It's like... a less graphical and worse version of Postman, sort of? I don't know if I like it yet.

**Bonus TIL**: `Option + Shift + .` is multi-select in Visual Studio for Windows.
