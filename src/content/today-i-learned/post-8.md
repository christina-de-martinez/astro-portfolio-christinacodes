When it comes to CSS layouts, I reach for Flexbox over Grid 99.99% of the time. But I recently saw [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DPwWP14aUs) by [my friend Chris](https://codinginpublic.dev/) that was a pretty compelling argument that nowadays, Grid is a great choice in lots of situations.

I ran into a situation at work that I thought could benefit from Grid over Flexbox and used some of the tips from that video. It was cool to see that Grid can handle responsive layouts nowadays. Definitely worth a watch every now and again if you're married to Flexbox like me.
