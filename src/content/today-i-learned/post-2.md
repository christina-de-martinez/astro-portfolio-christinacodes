The GitHub UI allows you to bulk edit pull requests. I closed over 200 automated pull requests from a tool called Snyk this way.

Snyk is really cool. But it can cause a lot of PRs—sometimes duplicates—and if you're not on top of them, they can build up. But my repo is for a site that doesn’t handle any customer data, is almost never visited, and isn’t really maintained. I know it’s not best practice to not care about dependency updates, but this was my old portfolio site that nobody ever visited.
