I used SQL for the first time in real life, after having taken a Codecademy course and Select Star SQL. I learned about the Schemas tab in MySQL Workbench, which was useful to help me find the values that I wanted to augment in the test database.

_Helpful_: [Select Star SQL](https://selectstarsql.com/), an interactive public domain online book about SQL
